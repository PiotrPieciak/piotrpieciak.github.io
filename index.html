            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong analytical background and hands-on experience in statistical analysis, process optimization, and problem-solving. After completing an intensive Data Science & Machine Learning course, I am actively building real-world projects, applying Python and machine learning to business challenges.<br><br>

                For the past 15 years, I have worked in automotive and electronics manufacturing as a Supplier Quality Engineer and Quality Leader/Supervisor, specializing in data-driven decision-making, supplier development, and new product introduction. My experience includes working with global teams, leading negotiations, and implementing process improvements based on statistical analysis.<br><br>

                I have also spent 5 years collaborating directly with customers, ensuring flawless production start and quality assurance. I translated their expectations into scalable production processes, led on-site supplier visits, technical discussions, and worked closely with production teams to meet quality and efficiency targets.<br><br>
